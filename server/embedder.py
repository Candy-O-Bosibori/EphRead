# embedder.py — Convert text chunks into embedding vectors
# ============================================================
# An "embedding" is a list of 1536 numbers that represents the
# *meaning* of a piece of text. Similar sentences get similar
# numbers, so we can find related chunks by comparing numbers.
#
# Example:
#   "The ocean is deep"   → [0.02, -0.14, 0.87, ...] (1536 numbers)
#   "The sea is vast"     → [0.03, -0.13, 0.85, ...] (very similar!)
#   "I like pizza"        → [0.91,  0.44, -0.21, ...] (very different)
#
# We use OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model to generate these.
# Install the SDK with: pip install openai
